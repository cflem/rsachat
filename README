[ RSAChat Overview ]
This is a server/client suite for personal private messaging.
Authors: Carson Fleming, Vinayak Kurup

This is a real final version with a working GUI that has undergone some
hefty debugging. This suite uses users' RSA keys to verify their identity
and exchange keys for a symmetric cipher that protects the messages. Unlike
the beta version, this version is fully equipped, with RSA enabled an a
working GUI (which may be platform-dependent in some cases.)

This application works a lot like iMessage in that messages are sent
directly to one user as opposed to a lobby, and if that user is offline,
the messages will be fetched when they come back on.

[ Running the Client ]
The server is hardcoded to one that is running on my VPS for the testing
and peer review portion of development. To change the server or port, simply
change the run method in whichever User Interface (GUI, AntiG_UI, or a
custom one) you choose to use.

[ Running Your Own Server ]
In order to run a server of your own, you will need to compile the code in
server/ which can be done with the command:
  make
The server is heavily platform-dependent, and is only known to work on
linux-based systems, although OSX systems may work as well. Running the
server takes no arguments and can be done with:
  ./server
To change the port or the bind address, simply alter the main method in
the file chatsvr.c.

[ About the Default Server ]
The default server is running on a very low-end VPS of mine (Carson's) and
can't take much load, so if you plan on nuking the server, please do me a
solid and run your own for stuff like that.
